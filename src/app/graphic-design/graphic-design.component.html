    <p>Below is a list of the current top 5 active footballers in my opinion. </p>

    <p>Lionel Messi (FC Barelona):  Anything and everything every other player does gets instantly compared to the Argentine. Why? He is the best. At everything. He runs with the ball like no other player, passes a ball better than everyone else, and, of course, he scores alot of goals â€” 717 in total to date. </p>

    <p>Cristiano Ronaldo (Juventus):  Ronaldo had either scored or assisted in every one of Juventus' Serie A matches in 2020 as they march almost unopposed towards another Scudetto. He currently has five UEFA Champions Leagues to his name, Europe's toughest competition to win. </p>

    <P>Robert Lewandowski (Bayern Munich):  In 2020: 21 goals, four assists. Won Bundesliga & DFB Pokal. The Poland international has been in blistering form in 2020, having fired Bayern to a domestic double while helping make them the favourites to win the Champions League.</P>

    <p>  Neymar (Paris Saint-Germain):  Won the French Ligue 1 and led PSG to the Champions League final. Has 1 UEFA Champions League title to his name and 3 Ligue 1 titles.</p>
